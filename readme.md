Snake Game: This is one of the projects that Angela, 
my Python teacher, assigned. It is challenging but beneficial 
as it tests skills and induces stress. I had to take breaks 
that ranged from half an hour to days.

before starting writing the code i play the snake games few times, 
after years that i don't play to it,
i used to play to it when i was child maybe 13 or 14 years on my 
Motorola c115, then i tought about the game meccanics e separated in block

Initially, I coded in a cascading way, then it became messy. 
I updated it a second time with OOP.
